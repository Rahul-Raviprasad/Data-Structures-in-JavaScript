//LinkedLists

/*
LinkedList is a collection of objects called nodes. Each node is linked to a
successor node in the list using an object reference. The reference to another
node is called a link.

While Array elements are referenced by their positions,
linked list elements are referenced by their relationship to other elements
of the linked list, and the last node points to a null node.

Marking the beginning of the LinkedList can be a problem, many implementations
have a special node called head to denote the beginning of the LinkedList.

Insertion and removal are the main functions of a LinkedList.
