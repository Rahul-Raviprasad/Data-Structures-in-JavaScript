# Sets

A set is an unordered collection of related members in which no members occurs more than once. A set is denoted mathematically like {1,3, 5, 91}. we can have this any order for example {3,1,91,5}, the order does not matter.

## Set Definitions
An empty Set : A set containing no members
The Universe : A set of all possible numbers
Two sets are considered equal if both contain exactly the same members
A set is considered a subset of another set if all the numbers of the first set are contained in the second set.


## Set Operations

The fundamental operations performed on set are :
Union: A new set is obtained by combining the members of one set with the members of another set
Intersection : A new set is obtained by adding all the members of one set that also exists in a second set.
Difference: A new set is obtained by adding all the members of one set except those that also exist in a second set.
