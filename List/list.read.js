//LISTS

/*
Lists are particularly useful when we don't have to perform searches on the items
in the list or put them in some sort of sorted order.
When we need to perform long searches or complex sorts, lists become less useful


A List is an ordered sequence of data. Each data item stored in a list is
called an element this can be of any data type

A list with no elemnts is an empty list
The number of elements stored in the list is called the length of the list
Internally the number of elements in a list is kept in a listSize variable
